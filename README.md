# Fractalist

# Project Description

The project creates a fractal Spotify playlist cover based on attributes of the music in a playlist, specifically valence, mode, and energy. Users would also be able to customize the cover by modifying various elements such as font and color. The fractal image can then be downloaded to the userâ€™s device or automatically uploaded to Spotify.

# Implementation




## Song Attributes
The attributes displayed in the fractal

**Mode:** modality (major or minor) of a song, (0 or 1)

**Valence:** positivitiness of a song, (value between 0.0 and 1.0)

**Energy:** intensity and activity of a song, (value between 0.0 and 1.0)


## Coloring Algorithm
The coloring of the fractal is implemented based on average values for features of the songs in a playlist:

### Mode:
**Major:** converts all black to white
  
**Minor:** converts all white to black
  
### Valence:  
**High valence:** warmer colors will be used
**Low valence:** cooler colors will be used

### Energy:
**High energy:** colors will be brighter
**Low energy:** colors will be darker
